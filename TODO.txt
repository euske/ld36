Title: The (Ancient) Casher

Puzzle game?
A bit like Papers Please?

You are a casher at this ancient store and...
  There's no calculator. You have to add prices and calculate the tax.
  Tax ratio is changed every day.
  People want to cheat the change.
    There could be fake money.
    There could be a fake credit card.
  Each person has a patience level. (i.e. timeout)
    different speed for paying/counting/checking the money
  People are making a strange request.
    Old men/wheelchair people wants to carry a bag.
    Old people are slow.
    Some people are extremely inpatient.
    People asks cigallettes (but they have to be older than 20)
  Things to buy: meat, vegetable, canned food, toothbrush,
    detergent, milk, juice, rice bag,
  You have to handwrite a receipt.

  Each product has:
    a price, a box, weight, age restriction (tobaccos and alcohols)
    a different tax ratio? - too hard
      - meat pack
      - cookie (box), small or large
      - carrot? tomato? cabbage?
      - eggs (have to put carefully)
      - liquor
      - cans
  Customer has:
    an age (= speed / patience), bag size
      kid = slow and impatient, can't buy restricted stuff
      old = slow and patient
      youngin = fast and impatient
      adults = fast and patient, buy expensive stuff, use credit cards (could be fraud)
  Score = total revenue
  Game over = too many penalties
